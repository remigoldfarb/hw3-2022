    <div class="introduction">	
      <p>the popular american card game uno has simple rules, right?<br> wrong!<br> 
        
        here are some rules you're probably playing incorrectly.</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="red">	
      <h2>red -- if you don't have a card to play, you only have to pick up one card</h2>	
      <p>you don't have to keep drawing cards until you get one that matches the discard pile, and you can even play it right away!</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="blue">	
      <h2>blue -- you can't stack or chain cards</h2>	
      <p>sorry, you can't make your little brother pick up 6 cards by playing a draw 2 after a draw 4. If a draw card is played, the next player picks up the cards and misses their turn.</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="yellow">	
      <h2>yellow --  you can win with an action card</h2>	
      <p>wild, skip, even reverse - doesn't matter as long as it matches the color!</p>	
    </div>	
    <div class="green">	
      <h2>green -- in two player mode reverse is treated as a skip</h2>	
      <p>the other player's turn is skipped and you can play again right away. same with draw cards!</p>	
    </div>
